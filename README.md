# Retail Banking Recommendation System
Currency is one of the most important aspects in human life that is used worldwide as a method for exchanging. In order to maintain the balance of economy, retail banking has provided a lot of solutions, from credit cards, debit cards, loans, mortgages, and even some countries implemented the system of credit scores. Often time, the struggle to find the best bank in implementing those services can be a hinder for people in making the decision whether to use the service of a specific bank. Every retail banking will definitely promote the idea that they offer the best service in every aspect but the truth is that the complaints and feedbacks from customers will definitely provide a better idea of how a retail bank is performing. Unlike the bias references, we implemented a recommendation system that displays a certain result based on the valuable dataset of number of complaints from consumers toward specific bank and their services. A certain algorithm is being implemented to analyze the number of complaints and display the result depending on the preferable location from the user. Analysis of this will reveal the best bank according to the service in a specific location and also will bring new challenges to the retail banking in developing better services.
